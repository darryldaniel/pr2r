# pr2r

This is a web extension to add a button to Pull Request pages on GitHub which can open up a draft Release with information from the current Pull Request:
- source branch
- title
- summary
- tag, generated by reading existing tags and incrementing the last number in a dotted version string (ie 1.2 -> 1.3, 56 -> 57)

It's useful for people who use the feature-branch git flow where releases are done from the feature branch and validated before merging back into the main branch.
